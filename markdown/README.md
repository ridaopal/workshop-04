# Workshop 4

By: Rida Opal

## Emphasis

It then shouldn’t come as any surprise to realize that *Drake is the Chick-fil-A of rappers*. Fight as you must through this realization, but as a bona fide rap superstar for the past nine years, Drake’s vast catalog of music has mostly drifted towards the same types of songs over and over again, and no matter how many singles, albums, playlists, or loosies _October’s Own_ has ushered out, that process has never faltered.

## Strong

Drake is almost always good to great, yet almost **never transcendent**, just like how Chick-fil-A is mostly good to great, but __never the absolute best__. Similarly, Drake has always been the artist we listen to when we know what we want to consume, and we don’t have to stray too far from our typical meal to get a good, and sometimes great, experience.
